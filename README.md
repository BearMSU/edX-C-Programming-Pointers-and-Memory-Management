# edX-C-Programming-Pointers-and-Memory-Management
These are assignments and different programs written during the course of this MOOC

Please,

Before using the solutions in this repository I implore you to try and solve them yourself. The best way to learn how to code is to try and try again and troubleshoot yourself. If you are absolutely stuck or need a bit of guidance on the steps feel free to input from these different code solutions.

Also, by no means are my solutions the only way to get to the correct answer. There is more than one way to code a correct solution to these problems. The solutions I present are 1 or 2 ways in which this can be done.

Thanks and enjoy!
